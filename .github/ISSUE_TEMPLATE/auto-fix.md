**🤖 Automated Implementation:** Issues with titles starting with "auto" (case-insensitive) will automatically trigger an AI-powered workflow that:

1. ✅ Creates a working branch
2. ✅ Generates implementation context and task files
3. ✅ Opens a pull request ready for AI implementation
4. ✅ Provides GitHub Copilot Workspace link for automatic code generation
5. ✅ Enables GitHub Copilot for Pull Requests

**For automatic implementation:** After the PR is created, click the GitHub Copilot Workspace link in the PR description to have AI automatically implement the solution and commit the code.

**Alternative:** GitHub Copilot may also provide inline code suggestions directly in the PR comments.
